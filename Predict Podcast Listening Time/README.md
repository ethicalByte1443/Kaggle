## 📝 Evaluation Metric

### 📉 Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

Submissions are scored on the **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**, defined as:

\[
\text{RMSE} = \sqrt{ \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2 }
\]

Where:  
- \( \hat{y}_i \) is the **predicted** value  
- \( y_i \) is the **actual** value  
- \( N \) is the number of instances

## 🧠 About the Tabular Playground Series

The **Tabular Playground Series** aims to provide the Kaggle community with lightweight and practical challenges. These competitions are ideal for:

- Practicing **feature engineering** and **model tuning**
- Exploring **new algorithms**
- Building quick **end-to-end pipelines**
- Strengthening your **ML intuition**  
- Practicing submission handling and metric evaluation

Competitions are generally short (a few weeks), offering fast feedback cycles and flexible participation.

## 📊 Synthetically-Generated Datasets

To strike a balance between real-world relevance and secure testing:

- The datasets are **synthetically generated** using real-world distributions and naming conventions.
- Labels for test data remain hidden.
- This enables fair, public competitions without data leakage.
- Synthetic generation helps ensure fewer artifacts and richer structure.

> 📣 *Feedback is welcome to help improve future datasets!*
